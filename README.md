## To-Do List ApplicationðŸ“±
This is a Python-based To-Do List application built using the Tkinter library. It helps you organize your tasks efficiently with additional features such as marking tasks as complete, adding due dates, and visually distinguishing completed tasks.ðŸ’»ðŸ’»

## FeaturesðŸŒŸ
1. Add Task
Allows you to add a new task to the to-do list.
Tasks are entered in the input field and appear in the task list upon submission.

3. Delete Task
Lets you delete a selected task from the list.
Prevents accidental deletions by ensuring no task is deleted without selection.

5. Clear All Tasks
Removes all tasks from the list at once.
Includes a confirmation prompt to avoid unintended actions.

7. Mark/Unmark Tasks
Helps you toggle tasks between completed and pending states.
Completed tasks are marked with a green color and prefixed with a checkmark (âœ”).
Unmarking restores the task to its default state (black text with no prefix).

9. Add Due Date
Lets you add a due date or reminder for any selected task.
Prompts the user to enter a due date in the format of their choice (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).
Appends the due date to the task description.
